### Hi there 👋

**My name is Darya Shaban**.

I have a large experience of working with data, particularly in the financial sphere, since I lead audit projects for banks and asset management companies in 5 countries. During Yandex data science bootcamp I learned to utilize python and machine learning instruments to real-life problems. Also I have enriched my analytical, entrepreneurial skills and critical thinking while doing several consultancy and start-up projects. I am passionate about new technology and continuing education.
