### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

**My name is Darya Shaban**.

I am a Data Scientist at DELVE. I lead projects for nonprofits and for-profits, working with traditional machine learning, time series and statistical models.

This repository stores my out-of-work projects.

I have a large experience in finance, since I lead audit projects for banks and asset management companies in 5 countries. During Yandex data science bootcamp I learned to utilize python and machine learning instruments to real-life problems. Also I have enriched my analytical, entrepreneurial skills and critical thinking while doing several consultancy and start-up projects. I am passionate about new technology and continuing education.
